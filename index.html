            <h2>Why Fitness Is Important</h2>

            <p>
                While fitness is often associated with bodybuilding, there are numerous health benefits
                unrelated to building muscle. Fitness improves physical health, mental well-being,
                and overall quality of life.
            </p>

            <p>
                Regular exercise strengthens the heart, increases energy, and reduces stress.

        <section class="activity-section">
            <h2>Go Get Active!</h2>

            >

            <p>
                Many people think fitness is difficult, but staying active can include gym workouts,
                outdoor exercise, or simple daily movement.
